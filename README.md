***This program simulates data input from sensors attached to an
aquaponics system.*** 
 
 Each function should output a set of randomly generated data according
 to each probes needs. The data generated will eventually have to
 interact with each other. In the aquaponics system temperature, PH and
 ammonia levels are interrelated. Please see total ammonia nitrogen
 table. 
 
 ****Output we need generated:****
  
  ID, Date time, sensor values, alert status.
   
  **Alerts** for these ranges: 
  
  Low red , low orange, Green optimum, high orange and high red. To
  indicate certain ranges regarding the status of the system.

The system has following parameters: 

**Temperature**

**PH** 

**Ammonia**

The main file is server.js
